[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/powered-by-black-magic.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

Made for devotion to the tv series Silicon Valley, it's a Python script to alert with Napalm Death (like the Gilfoyle one) when Bitcoin price changes rapidly above or below a given threshold.

The price is fetched from CoinMarketCap API every 5 minutes and the default currency is USD.

## How to install and run code

- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python alert.py
