# Gilfoyle Bitcoin Alert

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/powered-by-black-magic.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

Made for devotion to the TV series Silicon Valley, it's a Python script that alerts with the Napalm Death sound (as the one used by Gilfoyle in Season 5 Episode 3) when the Bitcoin price changes rapidly above or below a given threshold.

The price is fetched from the [_CoinMarketCap API_](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) every 5 minutes and the default currency is USD.

## How to install and run code

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python alert.py`
